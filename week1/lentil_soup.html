        <h1 id="top"> Lebanese Sour Lentil Soup</h1>
        
        
    <p1>    For years I hated <em>3adas B7amod</em> and would put my frowny face on when my mom would cook it for lunch. I randomly had the urge to cook it after a year away from Lebanon and I think it's one of the tastiest, most amazing soup you could ever make. (it's really easy and vegan too!)
