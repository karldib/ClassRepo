# Wireframing
### reflection

After reading this artictle I feel more confident in my process leading up to getting a wireframe approved and designing successful design solutions. It was not a surprize to me that communication between the teams is key to harmonious and efficient website development. 

It also reminded me of the importance of the work done digging deep into the problem and the audience targeted in order to design a useful and appropriate website.
