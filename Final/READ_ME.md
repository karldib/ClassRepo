My portfolio required the usage of skilled I know as well as ones I had to teach myself such as:

1. Implementing a popup system for ads
2. Using sound, creating a button that can start and pause.
3. Using animations on my elements (rotation)
4. Making P5 sketches look implemented on my website
5. Using online libraries like bootstrap and greensock

What I really struggled with:

1. Positionning with bootstrap
2. Making my ads draggable using greensock (failed)
3. Adding pictures to my ads

Next steps:

1. making my about page more stable and informing
2. creating a little slideshow for my visual art in my about page.
3. figuring out draggable ads !
