# Lebanese Sour Lentil Soup
For years I hated that soup and would put my frowny face on when my mom would cook it for lunch. I randomly had the urge to cook it after a year away from Lebanon and I think it's one of the tastiest, most amazing soup you could ever make. (it's really easy too!)
## Ingredients
- 1 cup of lentils
- 3 potatoes
- 1 fat onion
- 4 cups of water
- 1 lemon
- 1 bag of baby spinach
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Recipe
1. Mince the onion into thin pieces
2. Heat olive oil in a casserole
3. Fry onion on medium heat until transluscent 
4. Add Lentils and 2 cups of water and let boil
5. After having peeled and cut the potatoes into cubes, place them in boiling water
6. Add the rest of the water then cover and let cook for 20 minutes
7. Stir the soup and add salt to taste
8. Add sliced baby spinach and let cook for 5 minutes
9. Squeeze the lemon and add juice to the soup
10. Make sure potatoes and Lentils are fully cooked then turn off heat

### Tips
- If looking for richer flavor, add minced garlic widway through frying the onion.
- Serve hot and enjoy on a cold winter day!
